Networking Event - Kick-off #06
6 days ago by buttercp

On the 2nd of October at 4:00 p.m., 
you are invited to join us on the 4th floor, 
where 5 of your colleagues will present their 
projects to the new students and our partners. 
At 4:30 p.m., we'll have a networking session 
with 30-minute rounds, during which you will 
rotate through meetings with small groups, 
each with a specific partner. It is an excellent 
opportunity to get to know the companies that believe 
in you and make 42 possible in Portugal 📣! We'll 
wrap it up with a small cocktail 🍷! For logistics 
purposes, we ask you to subscribe to the event on Intra 🎯. 
We will prepare some materials in advance, counting 
on your confirmation. Please inform us at least two days 
in advance if you cannot attend. You can do that by 
unsubscribing from the event.
